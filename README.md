# 🤖 3D Arm Design

This project contains the 3D design of a robotic arm created using [Onshape](https://www.onshape.com/), and exported in STL format. It is part of a larger robotics project where this arm will be used in physical simulations or 3D-printed.

---

## 📌 Project Overview

The goal of this project is to:

- Design a simple robotic arm mechanism  
- Export it as a 3D model (STL)  
- Visualize different movement states  
- Use it for physical prototyping or further robotic control logic

---

## 🛠️ Tools Used

- **Onshape** for CAD modeling  
- **STL** file format for 3D printing  
- **GitHub** for version control and documentation
